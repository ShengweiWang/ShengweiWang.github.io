This week mainly I was focusing on the project 1, to get everything settle down. Acturally, it is sort of hard bacause the step for building the environment is not quite clear especially when you are not using a cs lab machine. It turns out the there is a key package that cannot be supported by Mac OS. To make things easier, I've decided to use cs lab machine, and the remote ssh. 

I think it is fuzzy to set the environment, because in python, every time I'd like to start a new project, I just need to use a virtual environment, and use pip install to get require packages. So that the it will be easy for developer to settle down and migrate to other machines. I don't know whether it is also common in c++.

I have to say, the tools that the project requires are really useful, besides the c++. I am working as a python developer, and the pinciple can also be applied into my work, such as the coverage detector, the unit_test principle. 

In class, we reviewed some features of c++. I've not touched c++ for a long time, it is interesting to find out that some tricky argument, like ++i = 3 is also legal. Although in real word, ambigous code makes team member frustrated, it is important to make sure we can solve problem related to that when it happens.

By the way, I think the time for quiz is kind of short. Especially, when it comes an algorithm optimization which you need to prove so that you can be sure about your answer.
